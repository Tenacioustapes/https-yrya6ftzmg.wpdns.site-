# 🐛 Issue: Product Appears in Application Guide but Does NOT Appear in Global Search Results

## What's happening

When viewing the Application Guide, the product **M543 – DS General Purpose Tissue** appears correctly in the list.

Clicking it from the Application Guide takes you to the correct product page.

**BUT** when searching for "M543" (or the product name) in the global site search, the product does not appear at all.

Instead, only pages like Application Guide and Home appear.

## Why this is a problem

- The product is published and publicly accessible, so it should exist in the search index.
- Customers searching by product code will not find it.
- Inconsistent behaviour:
  - → Appears in Application Guide
  - → Does NOT appear in global search

This suggests the product is being:
- Excluded from search queries
- OR Not indexed by the search engine
- OR Missing searchable custom fields (SKU field not mapped)
- OR Search is misconfigured to only return WooCommerce products of a specific type/category

## Expected behaviour

- The product should appear when searching M543, its SKU, or its product name.
- Search results should always include all published products.

## Details

**Area:** Search  
**Concern:** Product appears in Application Guide but does not appear in global search results.

**Example:**
- Product M543 shows correctly in the Application Guide and links to its product page.
- However, searching "M543" in the global search returns only pages (Application Guide, Home).
- Product does not appear as a search result despite being published.
- Expected: Product should appear in global search results for SKU, product code, or name.

Issue #14: Valid Product Images Intermittently Fail to Upload (Server Load?)
================================================================================
Priority: P0
Status: OPEN
Labels: bug, team-developer, Jordan FB, backend, uploads

# 🐛 Issue: Valid Product Images Intermittently Fail to Upload (Server Load?)

## Summary

When uploading a **1024 × 1024 PNG** image, the system sometimes shows:

> "The server cannot process the image. This can happen if the server is busy or does not have enough resources to complete the task. Uploading a smaller image may help. Suggested maximum size is 2560 pixels."

This should **not** happen, as the image is well under the stated 2560px limit.

## Behaviour

- **Image:** `t710tbh_new.png`
- **Dimensions:** **1024 × 1024 px**, 96 dpi, 24-bit PNG
- Well within normal upload limits.

**Observed:**

- On first upload attempt, error appears as above.
- After refreshing the page and trying again, **the same file sometimes uploads successfully**.
- This suggests an **intermittent server load / resource issue**, not a genuine size/dimension problem.
- Error message always points to "maximum size 2560px", which is misleading in this case.

## Expected

- Valid images (e.g. 1024 × 1024 PNGs) should upload reliably without errors.
- If the server is out of resources, the error message should clearly indicate a **server/resource issue**, not imply the image is too large.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Edit a product and go to the image upload area.
2. Upload `t710tbh_new.png` (1024 × 1024 PNG).
3. Observe: upload sometimes fails with the "server cannot process the image" error.
4. Refresh the page and try the **same file** again.
5. Observe: upload may now succeed.

## Suspected Cause

- Intermittent **server load / resource limits**:
  - PHP `memory_limit`, `post_max_size`, `upload_max_filesize`
  - GD/Imagick library running out of memory or timing out
- Error message is generic and misleading (points to size instead of server load).

## Tasks

- [ ] Check server error logs around the time of failed uploads.
- [ ] Confirm PHP memory and upload limits.
- [ ] Verify GD/Imagick configuration and any timeouts.
- [ ] Adjust limits

Issue #16: Search Does Not Return Products by SKU or General Terms
================================================================================
Priority: P0
Status: OPEN
Labels: bug, team-developer, Jordan FB, area-search, area-product-catalog
Assignees: Unassigned
Created: 2025-11-14
Updated: 2025-11-14

Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🐛 Issue: Search Does Not Return Products by SKU or General Terms

## Summary

The global search/autocomplete does **not** return products even when:

- The exact **SKU** is entered
- The product is **published** and **in stock**
- The product clearly exists in the WooCommerce product catalog

## Example

- **SKU:** T710TBH
- **Product:** Double Sided Foamed Acrylic – Bonding Tape
- **Search term entered:** `t710tbh`
- **Result:** **"No results found"**

Meanwhile, the product is visible in the admin product list with SKU correctly set to `T710TBH`.

## Expected

- Typing a product SKU (e.g. `T710TBH`) should return the matching product.
- General product terms (e.g. part of the product name) should also return the product.
- Search should include **WooCommerce products + their SKU fields**, not just pages/posts.

## Actual

- Search returns **no results** for valid SKUs.
- Search appears to only return certain pages (e.g. Application Guide, Home) and ignores products.
- This affects both autocomplete dropdown and full search results.

## Possible Causes (for developer)

- Search is configured to index **pages only**, not products.
- The SKU field is not included in the searchable fields.
- The search plugin (or theme search override) may be excluding product post type.
- Search index needs rebuilding after migration/import.

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm which post types are being searched (pages vs products).
- [ ] Ensure WooCommerce products are included in search results.
- [ ] Include SKU field in search index so users can search by product code.
- [ ] Rebuild/refresh search index if required.
- [ ] Test multiple products (including T710TBH) to confirm SKUs and names return results as expected.

## Details

**Area:** Global Search  
**Concern:** Search does not return products when searching by SKU or product name.

**Example:**
- Product "Double Sided Foamed Acrylic – Bonding Tape" has SKU **T710TBH** and is publi

# 🐛 Issue: Homepage Link Testing - Application Category Tiles Show Same 404 Errors

## Summary

# 🐛 Issue: Critical Performance - 75 Blocking Scripts and 47 Blocking Stylesheets

## Summary

The homepage has **75 render-blocking scripts** and **47 render-blocking stylesheets**, causing significant performance degradation. This directly impacts Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS) and user experience.

## Performance Metrics (Homepage)

**Resource Count:**
- **Scripts:** 111 total (75 blocking, 36 non-blocking)
- **Stylesheets:** 47 (all blocking)
- **Images:** 57
- **Inline Styles:** 13

**Page Load:**
- Total Load Time: ~985ms
- DOM Content Loaded: ~925ms
- First Paint: Not captured (likely > 1s)
- First Contentful Paint: Not captured

## Problem

### Render-Blocking Resources:
1. **75 Blocking Scripts** - No `async` or `defer` attributes
2. **47 Blocking Stylesheets** - All stylesheets block rendering
3. **No Resource Hints** - Missing `preload`, `prefetch`, `dns-prefetch`
4. **No Script Optimization** - Scripts loaded synchronously

### Impact:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Delayed by blocking resources
- **FID/INP (Interaction):** Scripts block main thread
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Stylesheets cause layout shifts
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time):** High due to blocking scripts
- **User Experience:** Slow page load, poor mobile performance
- **SEO:** Google penalizes slow-loading sites

## Expected Behavior

- Critical CSS should be inlined
- Non-critical CSS should be deferred or loaded asynchronously
- Scripts should use `async` or `defer` where appropriate
- Resource hints should be implemented for critical resources
- Images should be lazy-loaded
- Scripts and stylesheets should be minified and combined

## Tasks

# 🐛 Issue: Search Result Shows Strange "(Product)" Text Under Listing

## What's happening

When searching for a product (e.g., "PT159"), the autocomplete search dropdown displays a strange line of text:

```
(Product)
```

This appears under the product description and looks like:
- A leftover taxonomy label
- A debug field
- An internal post type
- Or a misconfigured Elementor/WooCommerce meta field

This text is **not intended for customers** and looks unprofessional.

## Why it's an issue

- Confuses users because it provides no value
- The formatting is inconsistent with the rest of the UI
- Likely exposing internal post type slug or taxonomy name
- Reduces trust in the search feature

## Expected behaviour

Autocomplete results should only show:
- Product image
- Product title
- Short description (if needed)

There should be **no internal labels** or metadata visible.

## Details

**Area:** Search / Autocomplete  
**Concern:** Autocomplete result displays unintended "(Product)" text.

**Example:**
- When searching for "PT159", the dropdown shows a line "(Product)" beneath the description.
- This appears to be internal metadata (post type, taxonomy, or template leftover).
- Should not be visible to users.
- Expected: Only product image, title, and description in results.

Issue #12: Bullet Point Text Alignment Incorrect in Features Section

Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🐛 Issue: Bullet Point Text Alignment Incorrect in Features Section

## Summary

Bullet points in the Features section are rendering with incorrect indentation.

The second line of wrapped text is misaligned, starting under the bullet icon instead of beneath the first word.

## What's happening

- Multi-line bullet points are indented inconsistently.
- The second line of each bullet appears too far left.
- This causes the text to misalign vertically and makes the list difficult to read.

## Expected behaviour

- Wrapped lines should align directly under the first word of the bullet point text (standard HTML list formatting).
- The bullet icon should not affect indentation.
- CSS should apply proper list-style-position and padding so indentation is consistent.

## Visual Reference

**Actual (incorrect):**
- Second line sits under the bullet icon
- Uneven alignment across bullets

**Expected (correct):**
- Second line aligns under the first text word, not the bullet
- Clean and readable structure

## Possible cause

CSS override on:
- `ul li::marker`
- `padding-left`
- `text-indent`
- `list-style-position: inside` (likely incorrect)
- Theme or WooCommerce product template altering default list indentation.

## Details

**Area:** Styling – Product Page  
**Concern:** Bullet point alignment is incorrect for multi-line items.

**Example:**
- In the Features list, wrapped text lines start beneath the bullet icon instead of beneath the first text word.
- This creates uneven indentation across all list items.
- Expected: Wrapped lines align directly under the first word, following standard HTML list formatting.
- Likely caused by CSS on `ul li` or `list-style-position`.

# 🐛 Issue: "Recently Viewed" Widget Showing Incorrect/Unexpected Behaviour (Sidebar + Pricing)

## Summary

The Recently Viewed feature displays inconsistently across the site.

Some elements appear to be unintended, and others are showing incorrect information (such as pricing).

This issue consolidates all known problems.

## ✅ Sub-Issues / Tasks

### 1. Sidebar Recently Viewed – Possibly Unintended

- Confirm whether the left sidebar Recently Viewed widget is part of the intended design
- If NOT intended: Remove the sidebar widget entirely
- If it is intended: update it to match header behaviour (see below)

### 2. Sidebar Spelling Error

- Fix typo in sidebar heading:
  - "RENCENTLY VIEWED" → "RECENTLY VIEWED"
- (This becomes irrelevant if the sidebar is removed.)

### 3. Pricing Should Not Display Anywhere

- Remove pricing from sidebar Recently Viewed
- Ensure pricing is removed globally from all Recently Viewed widgets
- Confirm default behaviour = no price shown for any product in any Recently Viewed component

### 4. Product List Mismatch (Header vs Sidebar vs Category Sidebar)

- Sidebar Recently Viewed shows products A + B
- Header Recently Viewed shows different items
- Category-menu Recently Viewed (left side of product category pages) shows nothing
- Unify the data source so all intended Recently Viewed components use the same list (or remove the extras)

### 5. Left-Menu Category Recently Viewed – Should It Exist?

- Confirm whether Recently Viewed is intended to appear in category side menus at all
- If NOT intended → remove from category side menus
- If intended → connect to the correct data source used by the header widget

## 🔍 Examples Observed

- PVDF Membrane Butyl Tape appears in sidebar Recently Viewed with price
- PT159 Chromakey Cloth Matt Tape also shows in sidebar with price
- These same items do not appear in category sidebar Recently Viewed
- But appear in the header dropdown Recently View

# 🐛 Issue: "Popular Products" Block Still Showing on Category Parent Pages

## Summary

When clicking on a **parent category menu item** (e.g. **Double Sided Tapes**), a **"Popular Products"** section appears at the top of the category page.

This block shows featured products with "TOP 01 / TOP 02 / TOP 03 / TOP 04" badges.

This section was expected to be **removed from the design**, but it is still displaying.

## Location

- Parent category pages, e.g.:
  - `Double Sided Tapes` (and possibly other top-level tape categories)

## Expected

- No "Popular Products" row/section should appear at the top of parent category pages

**OR**

- If it must exist, it should only appear where explicitly agreed in the design (to be confirmed).

## Actual

- "Popular Products" block appears automatically at the top of the category content.
- Pushes real product listing further down the page.
- Creates confusion about whether these are curated promos vs. normal category results.

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm whether "Popular Products" is meant to appear at all on category pages.
- [ ] If **not** intended → remove this block entirely from parent category templates.
- [ ] If only intended for specific pages → limit its display to those only.
- [ ] Clear any leftover Elementor/WooCommerce widgets or template parts that auto-inject this section.

## Details

**Area:** Category Pages / Product Display  
**Concern:** "Popular Products" block appearing on parent category pages when it should be removed.

Issue #17: Sidebar Shows Incorrect Product Category Filters for Current Page

# 🐛 Issue: Sidebar Shows Incorrect Product Category Filters for Current Page

## Summary

When viewing certain **single-sided tape** related pages (e.g. tag page **"SS Joining, Sealing & Repair"**), the left-hand sidebar **Product Categories** menu shows categories that don't match the user's current context.

## Example

- User is effectively in a **Single Sided** context
- Sidebar still shows **Double Sided Tapes**, **Safety Tapes**, **Other Products** etc.
- In some cases, a user can click a single-sided category but the sidebar continues to show **double-sided filters**, which is confusing.

This makes it unclear which range the user is actually filtering and browsing.

## Expected

- Sidebar filters should match the **current range or context**.
- If user is in a **Single Sided** context:
  - Only relevant single-sided categories/filters should be shown.
- Cross-range filters (e.g. Double Sided when browsing Single Sided) should not appear unless explicitly required by design.

## Actual

- Sidebar displays a **global product category tree** (Single Sided, Double Sided, Safety, Other Products) regardless of the user's current range/tag.
- Users can be on a Single Sided-related page while still seeing Double Sided filters in the sidebar.
- This creates the impression that they're filtering single-sided products, but the UI suggests multiple ranges at once.

## Tasks

- [ ] Confirm intended behaviour for sidebar filters on:
  - Tag pages (e.g. "SS Joining, Sealing & Repair")
  - Single Sided vs Double Sided vs Safety ranges
- [ ] Update sidebar widget/template logic so that category filters:
  - Reflect only the relevant range/context
  - Or clearly distinguish cross-range navigation if that's desired
- [ ] Test with several Single Sided and Double Sided pages to ensure filters always match the current page context.

# 🐛 Issue: Application Guide Page - Multiple Product Links Are Broken Placeholders

## Summary

The Application Guide page contains an interactive comparison table with product codes. **15-20 product codes** link to `/application-guide/#` which are broken placeholder anchor links that don't navigate to product pages. This prevents users from accessing product information from the comparison table.

## Test Results

### ✅ **WORKING Product Links (Sample Tested):**

- ✓ **A591** → `/product/ds-crepe-tape/` - Works
- ✓ **M543** → `/product/ds-general-purpose-tissue/` - Works (verified with full product page)
- ✓ **M545** → `/product/ds-hd-general-purpose-tissue/` - Should work
- ✓ **M593** → `/product/ds-tissue/` - Should work
- ✓ **N520** → `/product/ds-premium-tissue-tape/` - Should work

### ❌ **BROKEN Product Links (Placeholder "#" links):**

These product codes link to `/application-guide/#` which is just an anchor that doesn't navigate anywhere:

#### **Tissue Category:**
- ❌ **M509** → `#` anchor only (confirmed broken)

#### **Transfer Category:**
- ❌ **B333** → `#`

#### **Cloth Category:**

## Statistics

- **Working Links:** ~5+ verified working
- **Broken Links:** 15+ confirmed broken (placeholder `#` links)
- **Estimated Total Broken:** 15-20 product codes
- **Failure Rate:** Approximately 60-75% of product links in comparison table

## Root Cause

Product codes in the Application Guide comparison table are linking to:

# 🐛 Issue: Product Pages Have Inconsistent Button Layout - Some Missing "Product Info"

## Summary

Product pages across the website have **inconsistent button layouts**. Some product pages display both "Product Info" and "Enquire" buttons, while other product pages only show "Enquire" with no "Product Info" button. This creates an inconsistent user experience.

# 🐛 Issue: Missing Product Images and Empty Link Placeholders

## Summary

Multiple product pages show empty link placeholders (e.g., "【18†】", "【52†】", "【53†】") with no visible text, images, or product names. This indicates missing product data, incomplete CMS entries, or broken product links.

## Problem Description

- **Location:** "Tapes By Application" page and category pages
- **Examples:** 
  - "【18†】" appears twice with no content

Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🐛 Issue: Repeated and Redundant Category Lists on Category Pages

## Summary

Category pages display the entire "Tapes By Application" navigation list multiple times - appearing below the header, in the sidebar, and again further down the page. This creates unnecessary duplication and clutters the page.

## Problem Description

### Navigation Duplication:
- **Location:** Category pages (e.g., Agriculture & Horticulture, Auto & Marine)
- **Issue:** The same "Tapes By Application" list appears:
  1. Below the header
  2. In sidebar navigation
  3. Further down the page (duplicated)
- **Also:** Main menu categories are repeated multiple times

### Impact:
- Pages become unnecessarily long
- Same navigational options presented repeatedly
- Dilutes focus from actual product listings
- Confusing user experience
- Wastes screen space

## Expected Behavior

Navigation should appear:
- ✅ Once in a logical location (sidebar or header)
- ✅ Use breadcrumbs for context instead of full category lists
- ✅ Focus on product listings, not repeated navigation

## Recommendations

1. **Display category list only once:**
   - Ideally in sidebar or dropdown menu
   - Not repeated multiple times on same page

2. **Use breadcrumbs for context:**
   - Show parent categories via breadcrumb trail
   - Example: Home > Adhesive Tapes > Single Sided > [Current Category]

3. **Simplify navigation:**
   - Remove redundant category lists
   - Keep navigation in one consistent location

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit all category pages for navigation duplication
- [ ] Identify where category lists are repeated
- [ ] Remove duplicate navigation elements
- [ ] Implement breadcrumb navigation for context
- [ ] Ensure navigation appears only once per page
- [ ] Test navigation still works correctly after cleanup

# 🐛 Issue: Incomplete Product Names and Descriptions

## Summary

Multiple product entries show placeholder codes (e.g., "【52†】", "【53†】") or truncated names instead of complete product information. Some products have prices but no names, or have incomplete/truncated descriptions.

## Problem Description

### Missing Product Names:
- **Examples:**
  - "【52†】" followed by "$20.49" (no product name)
  - "【53†】 High Specification Flame Retardant Coth Tape" (missing spacing, truncated)
- **Location:** Category pages, product listings

### Generic Labels Without Detail:
- Items like "Hook & Loop – Adhesive" and "Hook & Loop – Sew On" appear in lists
- May not be linked to product detail pages
- Lack complete product information

### Impact:
- **User Frustration:** Users cannot understand what products are
- **Search Issues:** Products cannot be found via search (Issue #16 related)
- **SEO Impact:** Search engines cannot index incomplete products
- **Conversion:** Missing information prevents purchases

## Root Cause

Likely causes:
1. **Incomplete data entry** - Products created but names/descriptions not added
2. **Data import issues** - Product names truncated during migration
3. **CMS field limits** - Descriptions cut off due to character limits
4. **Placeholder products** - Draft products not properly completed

## Expected Behavior

All products should have:
- ✅ Complete, descriptive product names
- ✅ Full product descriptions (not truncated)
- ✅ Proper spacing and formatting
- ✅ Links to detailed product pages
- ✅ No placeholder codes in product names

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit all product listings for incomplete names

- [ ] Find products with truncated names or descriptions
- [ ] For each incomplete product:
  - [ ] Add complete product name
  - [ ] Add full product description
  - [ ] Fix spacing and formatting issues

# 🐛 Issue: Accessibility Concerns - Missing Alt Text, Heading Hierarchy, Link Text

## Summary

The website has multiple accessibility issues including missing alt text for images, improper heading hierarchy, and links with generic or blank text. These issues prevent screen readers from properly conveying information and reduce accessibility compliance.

- **Problem:** Headings don't follow logical order (should be H1 for page titles, H2 for main sections)
- **Impact:** Screen readers and assistive technologies cannot navigate pages effectively

### Link Text Clarity:
- **Issue:** Several links use generic labels or blank anchors
- **Examples:** Empty anchor tags, placeholder codes as link text

- ✅ Alt text describes image content and purpose
- ✅ Decorative images have empty alt="" attribute

### Heading Hierarchy:
- ✅ H1 for page title (one per page)
- ✅ H2 for main sections

# 🐛 Issue: Resources Page - Multiple Broken Anchor Links in Sidebar Navigation

## Summary

The Resources page (`/resources/`) has multiple navigation links in the sidebar that point to anchor links (`#`) instead of actual pages. These links appear clickable but don't navigate anywhere.

## Problem Description

### Broken Anchor Links:
On the Resources page sidebar, the following links all point to `#` (anchor links):
- **Protection & Masking** → `#`
- **SS Joining, Sealing & Repair** → `#`
- **Printing, Display & Graphics** → `#`
- **Flooring, Exhibition & Staging** → `#`
- **Electrical** → `#`
- **Construction & Thermal Insulation** → `#`
- **Packaging & Strapping** → `#`
- **DS Joining, Splicing & Laminating** → `#`

### Impact:
- **User Experience:** Users click links expecting navigation, but nothing happens
- **Confusion:** Links appear functional but are non-functional

- **Professional Appearance:** Broken links make the site look incomplete

## Expected Behavior

These links should either:
1. **Link to actual pages** (e.g., `/product-tag/protection-and-masking-tapes/`)
2. **Be removed** if they're not meant to be functional
3. **Link to appropriate content** if they're meant to filter resources by application

## Location

- **Page:** https://yrya6ftzmg.wpdns.site/resources/
- **Section:** Left sidebar navigation
- **Element:** "TAPES BY APPLICATION" navigation list

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify intended destination for each broken link
- [ ] Update all `#` anchor links to point to correct pages:
  - [ ] Protection & Masking → `/product-tag/protection-and-masking-tapes/`
  - [ ] SS Joining, Sealing & Repair → `/product-tag/single-sided-joining-sealing-repair-tapes/`
  - [ ] Printing, Display & Graphics → `/product-tag/printing-display-graphics-tapes/`
