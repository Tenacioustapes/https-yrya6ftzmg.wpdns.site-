# Repository Permissions Explained

## Current Setup (Public Repository)

### Who Can Do What:

#### **Anyone (No Login Required):**
- ✅ **View issues** - Can see all issues
- ✅ **View comments** - Can read all comments
- ❌ **Cannot create issues** - Requires GitHub account
- ❌ **Cannot comment** - Requires GitHub account
- ❌ **Cannot close/edit issues** - Requires GitHub account + permissions

#### **GitHub Users (With Account, Not Collaborators):**
- ✅ **View issues** - Can see all issues
- ✅ **View comments** - Can read all comments
- ✅ **Create issues** - Can submit new issues
- ✅ **Comment on issues** - Can add comments
- ❌ **Cannot close/edit issues** - Only you (admin) can do this
- ❌ **Cannot assign** - Only collaborators can be assigned

#### **You (Repository Owner/Admin):**
- ✅ **Full control** - Create, edit, close, delete issues
- ✅ **Assign issues** - Can assign to collaborators
- ✅ **Manage labels** - Add/remove labels
- ✅ **Move to complete** - Close issues when done
- ✅ **All admin functions**

## How It Works

### For Public Users (No Account):
- They can **view** everything but **cannot interact**
- To create/comment, they need a GitHub account (free)

### For GitHub Users (With Account):
- They can **create issues and comment**
- But **cannot close/edit** - only you can do that
- This keeps you in control of issue status

### For You (Admin):
- You have **full control** over all issues
- Only you can close/move issues to complete
- Only you can edit issue titles/descriptions
- Only you can manage labels and assignments

## This Means:

✅ **Anyone can view** - Public access (no login needed)  
✅ **Anyone with GitHub can comment** - Encourages participation  
✅ **Only you can close/complete** - You maintain control  
✅ **Only you can edit** - You maintain quality  

## If You Want More Control:

### Option 1: Keep Current (Recommended)
- Public viewing (no login)
- Anyone with GitHub can comment/create
- Only you can close/edit
- **This is the standard GitHub model**

### Option 2: Make Repository Private
- Requires login to view
- Only collaborators can see
- More restrictive

### Option 3: Disable Issues for Public
- Only collaborators can create issues
- But then clients/staff can't submit

## Recommendation

**Keep it public** - This gives you:
- ✅ Maximum visibility (clients can see progress)
- ✅ Easy participation (anyone with GitHub can comment)
- ✅ You maintain admin control (only you close/edit)
- ✅ Best of both worlds

The fact that anyone with a GitHub account can comment is actually a **feature** - it encourages collaboration while you maintain control over issue status.
