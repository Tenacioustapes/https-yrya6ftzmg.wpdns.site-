| **History/Tracking** | Manual | Usually yes | Automatic |
| **Integration** | Limited | Varies | Extensive |

## Your Current Setup

You're using it perfectly for:
- ✅ **Website issue tracking** (not just code bugs)
- ✅ **Client feedback** (design, content, UX)
- ✅ **Team coordination** (who's working on what)
- ✅ **Progress visibility** (clients can see status)

## Tips for Non-Code Projects

1. **Use descriptive labels:**
   - `design`, `content`, `marketing`, `client-feedback`
   - `priority-high`, `priority-low`
   - `team-erin`, `team-developer`

2. **Create issue templates:**
   - Standard format for different issue types
   - Makes it easier for non-technical users

3. **Use milestones:**
   - "Phase 1: Design"
   - "Phase 2: Development"
   - "Phase 3: Launch"

4. **Leverage the description:**
   - Add context, requirements, examples
   - Include images/screenshots
   - Link to related issues

## The Bottom Line

GitHub Issues is essentially a **free, powerful, flexible project management system** that happens to be built into GitHub. The fact that it's associated with code is just branding - it's really a universal task/project tracker.

**You're using it exactly right!** 🎯
