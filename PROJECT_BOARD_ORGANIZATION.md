# GitHub Project Board Organization Recommendations

## Typical Project Board Columns

For a website development project, here's a recommended workflow:

### Column Structure:

1. **Triage** (Current location)
   - New issues that need review
   - Issues from Excel import
   - Client feedback items
   - **Action:** Review and categorize

2. **To Do / Backlog**
   - Issues ready to work on
   - Prioritized but not started
   - **Action:** Assign to team, set priority

3. **In Progress**
   - Issues currently being worked on
   - Active development/design
   - **Action:** Update regularly with progress

4. **Review / Testing**
   - Issues completed, awaiting review
   - Needs client/stakeholder approval
   - **Action:** Review and test

5. **Done / Complete**
   - Issues resolved and approved
   - Closed issues
   - **Action:** Archive/close

## Where to Put Your Current Issues

Based on your issues (1-7), here's my recommendation:

### **Triage** (Keep here for now):
- ✅ **Issue 3** - Image Compression Question (needs clarification)
- ✅ **Issue 9** - Sorting Menu Fields (needs investigation)

### **To Do / Backlog** (Move here):
- ✅ **Issue 1** - Mobile friendly (ready to work on)
- ✅ **Issue 4** - Default Sorting (general) (ready to work on)
- ✅ **Issue 5** - Default Sorting (tapes page) (ready to work on)
- ✅ **Issue 6** - Side Navigation Dropdowns (ready to work on)
- ✅ **Issue 7** - Product Applications List (ready to work on)
- ✅ **Issue 8** - Search Bar (when created, ready to work on)

### **Done / Complete**:
- ✅ **Issue 2** - Images Huge (RESOLVED) (already closed)

## Alternative: Organize by Priority

### **High Priority**:
- Issue 1 - Mobile friendly (affects all users)
- Issue 4/5 - Default Sorting (user experience)

### **Medium Priority**:
- Issue 6/7 - Side Navigation (UX improvement)
- Issue 8 - Search Bar (UX improvement)

### **Low Priority / Questions**:
- Issue 3 - Image Compression (question)
- Issue 9 - Sorting Menu Fields (question)

## Alternative: Organize by Type

### **Bugs**:
- Issue 1 - Mobile friendly

### **Enhancements**:
- Issue 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 - All UI/UX improvements

### **Questions**:
- Issue 3 - Image compression
- Issue 9 - Sorting fields

## My Recommendation

**Move issues based on readiness:**

1. **Triage** → Keep issues that need:
   - More information
   - Client clarification
   - Investigation

2. **To Do** → Move issues that are:
   - Clear and actionable
   - Have all needed info
   - Ready for development

3. **In Progress** → When work starts:
   - Add `team-developer` label
   - Move to In Progress
   - Update with progress comments

4. **Review** → When complete:
   - Move for client/stakeholder review
   - Add screenshots of changes

5. **Done** → When approved:
   - Close the issue
   - Move to Done column

## Quick Actions

**For your current issues, I'd suggest:**

```bash
# Issues ready to work on → Move to "To Do"
# Issues 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

# Issues needing info → Keep in "Triage"  
# Issues 3, 9

# Resolved → Move to "Done"
# Issue 2
```

Would you like me to help organize them in a specific way?
