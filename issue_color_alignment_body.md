## Issue: Color Selection Widget Alignment

**Area:** Product Page - Color Selection  
**Concern:** Alignment issue where "Color:" label and the color variable/value are not properly aligned (dropped down)

**Description:**
On product pages, the Color selection widget has an alignment issue. The "COLOR :" label and the color value (e.g., "GREEN") are not properly aligned - the color value appears to be dropped down or misaligned vertically.

**Example:**
The color selection shows "COLOR : GREEN" but the alignment between the label and the value is incorrect.
